I am a **Lead Data Scientist** at [HighLevel](https://www.gohighlevel.com/), where I focus on building and scaling Agentic AI systems using Large Language Models (LLMs). My work involves tackling complex NLP challenges at scale, specifically specializing in engineering production-grade RAG pipelines with tools like LangChain and LangGraph. My work also involves developing AI models to enhance SaaS business intelligence and establishing robust evaluation frameworks for LLM-based systems to drive measurable business impact.

Before HighLevel, I worked as a **Senior ML Engineer** at [Enphase Energy](https://enphase.com/) for nearly five years, where I spearheaded chatbot initiatives and developed AI models to detect hardware-product failures.

My career has been primarily focused on applied machine learning, bridging the gap between innovation and real-world applications.

I earned my B.Tech and M.Tech, along with an MBA minor, from [IIT Kanpur](https://www.iitk.ac.in/).

I enjoy blogging about Machine Learning, and I am currently working on a series of posts about NLP, MLOps, and Agentic AI architectures.
