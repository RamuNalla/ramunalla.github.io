I am a **Data Scientist** at HighLevel, where I focus on building and scaling Large Language Models (LLMs). My work involves NLP challenges, specializing in Transformers and ML systems engineering.

Before this, I worked as Senior ML Engineer at Enphase Energy, where I developed AI models to enhance business intelligence. I earned my B.Tech from **IIT Kanpur**.

I enjoy blogging about Machine Learning, and I am currently working on a series of posts about **Deep Learning in Computer Vision**.
